# CS210_Project1
    1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
    
    (PROMPT)
      The Chada Tech interviewing team has provided you with the following problem statement and a document containing a set of functional requirements:
Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and 
a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.

    2. What did you do particularly well?
    
      The utilization of logical functions that made the code functional, as well as readable for others who are updating or utilizing the code. 
      
    3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      For what the project is, I feel that the code itself is fairly efficient. I do not believe there to be much else I could update to this project. Ultimately, it would be nice to have a UI for users instead of 
      being strictly a console application. 
    
    4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
      Initially, the logic behind the time was difficult to perfect without errors. Specifcally, determining how to solve the change in 12pm to 1am, as well as 2359 to 0001. 
      Also, formatting the text and boxes in a way that was most effective and readable to the user took some time. 
   
    5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
      As previously stated, the utilization of functions became relevant in this project and will be implemented tremendously in future projects.
      
    6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      Every portion of this code falls within a different function, minimalizing the amount of code in main(). This allows for easy future manipulation and determining solutions for any problems 
      that may arise in the code as it develops more.
